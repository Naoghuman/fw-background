CONCEPT <Basic-Ideas for the framework 'Fw-Background'>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTENTION
In this concept I want to describe the basic ideas for the new framework 'Fw-Background'.

The basic features from the framework are splitted into 2 main sections.
 - An editor for crud background operations.
 - Functionalities for
    - drawing the background as 'Canvas' with JavaFX objects.
    - a writer and reader from the configured objects in a .json file.

Info:
JavaFX objects aren't per default serializable. So the question is how to persist 
effectly the used JavaFX objects with the relevant datas?
 - Should I create for every used JavaFX object an own pojo class
   or should I create for all classes converters?
 - An alternative is to write own functionalties to save, read JavaFX objects.
    - For example with MethodeHandle.lookup. Allowed the access from methods with 
      lambda (BiConsumer, BiFunction). So I need only the name from the methods 
      which are supported by the framework for a given JavaFX class and I can read, 
      write data to the objects.
